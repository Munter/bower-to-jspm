I needed a tool to help me look up packages for jspm. I had a bower config, now I just needed a quick way to look up where that package exists for jspm.

This tool solves that problem.


Usage
-----

```
npm install -g bower-to-jspm
cd path/to/your/bower/project
bower-to-jspm
```

Now your `bower.json` will be analyzed, the packages will be found on either npm or github and the corresponding result will look something like this:

```
unexpected-sinon
  jspm install npm:unexpected-sinon@5.1.2
  jspm install unexpected-sinon=github:sunesimonsen/unexpected-sinon@5.1.2
unexpected-dom
  jspm install npm:unexpected-dom@0.4.2
  jspm install unexpected-dom=github:Munter/unexpected-dom@0.4.2
react-simpletabs
  jspm install npm:react-simpletabs@0.6.1
  jspm install react-simpletabs=github:pedronauck/react-simpletabs@0.6.1
Keypress
  jspm install Keypress=github:dmauro/Keypress@2.1.0
unexpected
  jspm install npm:unexpected@6.4.0
  jspm install unexpected=github:sunesimonsen/unexpected@6.4.0
unexpected-react
  jspm install npm:unexpected-react@0.2.1
  jspm install unexpected-react=github:podio/unexpected-react@0.2.1
flux
  jspm install npm:flux@2.0.3
  jspm install flux=github:facebook/flux@2.0.2

```

Copy/paste the command line corresponding to the package endpoint you'd like to use.
